# abyssproject
this is a web design project I made.
I use a lot of bootstrap components but 
I also have my own custom CSS. 
I originally was making this for my tumblr
page. I wanted to test my web design skills 
with what I have learned.

The CSS is internal because I wanted this
to originally for Tumblr. Then I decided
not to use Tumblr but to just to use github
as a webhost.
